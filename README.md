The Bitcoin Wallet Analyzer is a Python-based graphical tool that allows users to load and analyze Bitcoin wallet files (.dat) generated by Bitcoin Core. The tool extracts encrypted keys (ckey), public keys, and addresses, providing a way to match them against a target Bitcoin wallet address. Built with PyQt6, the program offers a user-friendly interface for wallet analysis.

## Features:
Load and analyze Bitcoin Core .dat wallet files.
Extract and display encrypted keys, public keys, and public addresses.
Match specific target addresses and display relevant details.
Support for drag-and-drop and file browsing to load wallet files.
Visualize the Bitcoin public address generation process (SHA-256, RIPEMD-160).
How to Run the Program

## Prerequisites:
Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed, as well as pip to manage dependencies.

## Installation Steps:
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Mizogg/BitcoinWalletAnalyzer.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd BitcoinWalletAnalyzer
```

Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running the Application:

Once all dependencies are installed, run the program with the following command:

```
python main.py
```

The application window will open, where you can:

Enter a target wallet address in the provided field.
Load a Bitcoin Core wallet file (wallet.dat) using the "Load Wallet File" button or by dragging and dropping the file into the window.
The tool will display details about the encrypted keys, public keys, and any matches with the target address.

## Example:

Match found for address 1F654t1HxrZtg7uhcXyZeFvRsyB8HCnBXJ!
Encrypted ckey: 3e2c64bb5a632d7b3c0b6318d5bc9eb7efc0d3c71a20d4108696a5e9ac750c242764c73978c6809a8f5d033f75575609
Public key    : 0313c403e04becbcb83e93fbdd9eb9d1b04d9479bfc0864ef46c49a6ca266b6f1f
Raw address   : 009a873c5363eba23619bc1962d56e84277c9af969a763b5bd
Mkey_encrypted: e648d207eb6a457cc3b415e5e6db38759de529051d808b5d34c679c43020a233e6b5161de2e85070127009d61e4c24c8

## This output details:

The matching Bitcoin address.
The encrypted ckey (the encrypted private key).
The public key used to generate the Bitcoin address.
The raw address before encoding into the final Bitcoin address format.
The encrypted master key (mkey_encrypted) from the wallet file.


The functionality provided by this Bitcoin Wallet Analyzer can be useful in several specific scenarios, particularly for those who need to analyze or recover information from Bitcoin wallets. Here are some practical applications:

### 1. Recovering Lost Bitcoin Wallets
Purpose: People who have lost access to their Bitcoin wallets may still possess a wallet file (wallet.dat), but they lack the password or a matching private key.
Use Case: This tool allows users to extract and display the public keys, addresses, and encrypted private keys (ckey) from their wallet file. By identifying and matching a target address, users can focus on cracking or recovering the associated private key using tools like hashcat.
### 2. Forensic Cryptocurrency Investigations
Purpose: In legal, forensic, or investigative contexts, authorities may need to analyze Bitcoin wallets as part of a cybercrime or fraud investigation.
Use Case: This tool provides insights into the wallet file structure, helping forensic investigators identify the public addresses and encrypted keys stored within a wallet. They can then correlate this information with transactions on the blockchain to trace funds.
### 3. Cryptography & Educational Insights
Purpose: Enthusiasts, researchers, and students studying cryptography and blockchain technology may want to understand how public addresses are derived from public keys.
Use Case: The tool walks through each step of the address generation process, showing how SHA-256 and RIPEMD-160 hashes are applied, which can serve as an educational tool for understanding Bitcoin's cryptographic mechanisms.
### 4. Wallet File Compatibility Verification
Purpose: Someone may have a wallet file but is unsure if it's a valid Bitcoin Core wallet or if the file is corrupted.
Use Case: This tool verifies the structure of the wallet file, checking for the correct magic bytes and extracting keys. It can give users a clear indication if the file is usable or corrupted.
### 5. Identifying Target Addresses
Purpose: When dealing with multiple wallet files, you may be searching for a specific Bitcoin address that you know holds value.
Use Case: This tool allows the user to input a specific Bitcoin address, and the program will search the wallet file for that address and display its associated keys and other relevant details. This can help identify which wallet contains specific funds.
### 6. Managing Multiple Bitcoin Wallets
## Purpose: Users who maintain several wallets may lose track of which wallet holds specific funds.
Use Case: By loading different wallet files, users can quickly match addresses to find out which wallet holds their Bitcoin.
### Summary of Benefits:
### Recovery Aid: Helps in cases where access to a wallet is partially lost.
### Educational Tool: Illustrates how Bitcoinâ€™s public address system works.
### Forensic Use: Assists in tracking down wallets and tracing transactions.
### Compatibility Check: Verifies Bitcoin Core wallet structure and content.
### Key Extraction: Extracts critical information such as public keys and addresses.
In short, this tool provides a way to inspect wallet files, extract useful cryptographic details, and potentially assist in recovering access to Bitcoin addresses.
